= Embedded Languages Footprint
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:source-highlighter: rouge
:icons: font

== Overview

The sandbox project to investigate a footprint of various embedded languages.

The criteria for the language to be included into the project:

* C/C{pp} only (to ensure the best portability);
* No extra compilation dependencies (to build with the bare devkits);
* Actively maintained (to compile without its source code changes);
* Strong typing (to reduce the number of possible errors);
* Permissive license for both open source and commercial projects;

=== Code Transformation Requirements

The syntax of the language should be friendly to the required source code transformations.
The original list of the languages satisfied those requirements, but it has been
extended later to include other languages for the reference or testing purposes.

NOTE: While it's possible to transform the bytecode (where available) instead of the
original source code (thus lifting the requirement for its syntax), it could be not
an easy feat, esp. if the bytecode format is proprietary or could change any time.

Examples of possible source code transformations:

* Stripping debug and unused functionality;
* Minification of private symbols;
* Removing all newlines.

== Results

Sorted by the footprint (disk) size. The example code is the declaration
of the function that concatenates the fixed string ("Hello, ") with the output
of the external function ("read" that should return "world").

All code is verified to be properly returing "Hello, world"
as the result of invoking that function. Resident set size (RSS) is measured during execution of "read" function.

^[1]^ Wasm3 runs WebAssembly, therefore there is no reason to show the exact input
as it would be the binary content.
However, please see below the source code example that's compiled into that binary.

== Languages

Each language contains the section how to declare external function used
by the script (C{pp} lambda returning string "world").

=== TinyScheme

TinyScheme is a lightweight Scheme interpreter that implements as large a subset of R5RS as was possible without getting very large and complicated.
The TinyScheme project has slowly acquired foothold in many open-source projects over the years, notably http://www.gimp.org/docs/script-fu-update.html[GIMP].

=== Chibi-Scheme

Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension and scripting language in C programs. In addition to support for lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.
Despite the small size, Chibi-Scheme attempts to do The Right Thing. The default settings include:

 * a full numeric tower, with rational and complex numbers
 * full and seemless Unicode support
 * low-level and high-level hygienic macros
 * an extensible module system

Specifically, the default REPL language contains all bindings from R7RS small, available explicitly as the (`scheme small`) library. Chibi-Scheme is known to work on 32 and 64-bit Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X, Plan 9, Windows, iOS, Android, ARM and Emscripten. Basic support for native Windows desktop also exists.

 ** http://synthcode.com/scheme/chibi/lib/chibi/json.html[(chibi json)] - JSON reading and writing

=== Squirrel

Squirrel is a high level imperative, object-oriented programming language, designed to be a light-weight scripting language offering a wide range of features like:

 * dynamic typing
 * delegation
 * classes & inheritance
 * higher order functions
 * lexical scoping
 * generators
 * cooperative threads (coroutines)
 * tail recursion
 * exception handling
 * automatic memory management
 * optional 16bits characters strings

Squirrel is inspired by languages like Python, ECMAScript and especially Lua (the API is very similar and the table code is based on the Lua one).

=== ArkScript

Arkscript is:

 *  a functional language: every parameter is passed by value, everything is immutable unless you use mut to define a mutable variable
 *  powerful: it can handle object oriented programming in a very elegant way with its closures and explicit captures
 * a Lisp-like, but with less parentheses: `[...]` is expanded to `(list ...)` and `{}` to `(begin ...)`.

It also has a REPL with autocompletion and coloration

=== Gravity

Gravity is a powerful, dynamically typed, lightweight, embeddable programming language written in C without any external dependencies (except for stdlib). It is a class-based concurrent scripting language with modern Swift-like syntax.

Gravity supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming and data-driven programming. Thanks to special built-in methods, it can also be used as a prototype-based programming language.

Gravity has been developed from scratch for the https://creolabs.com/[Creo] project in order to offer an easy way to write portable code for the iOS and Android platforms.

Notes:

 - The project doesn't includes a REPL interpreter, but has a compiler allowing to compile and run its scripts.

=== Janet

Janet is a functional and imperative programming language and bytecode interpreter. It is a lisp-like language, but lists are replaced by other data structures (arrays, tables (hash table), struct (immutable hash table), tuples). The language also supports bridging to native code written in C, meta-programming with macros, and bytecode assembly.

There is a REPL for trying out the language, as well as the ability to run script files. It runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, BSDs, and should run on other systems with some porting.

=== ChaiScript

ChaiScript is one of the only embedded scripting language designed from the ground up to directly target C{pp} and take advantage of modern C{pp} development techniques, working with the developer how they would expect it to work. Being a native C{pp} application, it has some advantages over existing embedded scripting languages:

 - It uses a header-only approach, which makes it easy to integrate with existing projects.
 - It maintains type safety between the C{pp} application and the user scripts.
 - It supports a variety of C{pp} techniques including callbacks, overloaded functions, class methods, and STL containers.

The syntax resembles ECMAScript.

 - The compilation time is quite noticeable.

=== AngelScript

The scripting language follows the widely known syntax of C/C{pp}, but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks. Contrary to most scripting languages, AngelScript uses the common C/C{pp} datatypes for more efficient communication with the host application.

Notes:

 - Indentation and new lines sensitive.
 - The test application couldn't work without a subset of the Python standard library.
 It's embedded as a zip file into the executable, however it's not a portable solution.

==== Using Cython

https://cython.org/[Cython] is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.

It requires few more steps to use comparing with vanilla C/C++ usage, however the productivy gain outweights the build process changes. Please note that we don't use `--embed` feature (that generates `main`) as we need
to extract Python libraries first. Currently Cython doesn't support customization of `main()`, and it assumes that Python modules already available (not in our case). However, in general, Cython's `main` is not used much, as host environment usually have additional
functionality besides calling Python code.

The examples of the steps involved in using Cython are described below.

.Step 1. Write Cython code in `.pyx`-files:
[source,cython,indent=0]
----
include::src/python/cython_main.pyx[tag=declaration]
----

.Step 2. Compile Cython code into `.c`/`.h`-files:
[source,makefile,indent=0]
----
include::Makefile[tag=cython]
----

Please note that the name of the `.pyx`-file is used for exporting `PyInit`-function (`PyInit_cython_main` below).

.Step3. Register Cython modules in Python embedding code

=== MicroPython

MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

.External Function Declaration (for testing purposes only)
[source,cpp,indent=0]
----
include::src/micropython.cc[tag=native]
----

Notes:

 - MicroPython is not so friendly to the embedding, for example, it has the proper `lib` rule in the Makefile, but the generated library has `main` symbol that we had to localize using `objcopy`;
 - Not all macros work in C++, it's recommended to use pure C;
 - Generation of QSTR and external module definitions have to occur during MicroPython compilation, thus we had to take shortcuts for the test app.

=== Wasm3

A high performance WebAssembly interpreter written in C.

Homepage:: https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3

Current C++ headers do not allow to use lambdas directly, therefore the external functions
should be declared and registered separately.

include::src/wasm3/main.cc[tag=declare]
----

.External Function Registration
[source,cpp,indent=0]
----

----

Notes:

 - WASM doesn't support strings natively, thus we've added the simple memory manager exposing API
 to exchange the blobs with the host;
 - WASI is supported, but it adds just minor advantages for the project, therefore it wasn't used.

=== daScript

daScript is high-level, statically strong typed scripting language, designed to be fast as embeddable ‘scripting’ language for C++ performance critical applications like games.

Notes:

 - Two-style formatting (curly brackets or Python-style indenting).
 - Quite fast (and even faster with Ahead-of-Time compilation).
 - Extensive standard library (e.g. supports networking and JSON manipulation).
